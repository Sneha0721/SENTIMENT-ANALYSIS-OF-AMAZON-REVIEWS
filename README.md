# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-OF-AMAZON-REVIEWS
Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews --> In this project we first collected the data set then different preprocessing methods are applied on the data set like identifying the sentiments as positive and negative depending upon their ratings, after that we clean the reviews by removing the stop words. After that by analyzing the data we displayed the frequently used words for negative as well as positive sentiments. Then we used Bag of Words and Standard Scaler methods for converting the text data into numerical features. Once the data set is ready then we use Logistic Regression , Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest models to perform sentiment analysis and we compares the accuracy of different models.
